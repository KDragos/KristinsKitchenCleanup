# Kristin's Kitchen Cleanup 
## by Kristin Dragos

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [Unreal Engine 4 VR Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com)

For this project, I used UE4.15.3. Designed for and tested with the Oculus Rift and Touch controllers. The goal is to wash dishes, but not the balloons. Wash dishes to gain pionts. If a balloon gets washed you lose points. 

## 3rd Party Assets Used
I used some audio from the Oculus Audio sdk.
